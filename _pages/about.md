Hi! I’m Praveen Sahu, a PhD Candidate at Purdue University, West Lafayette, in the School of Engineering Technology. I’m an applied scientist by training with a background in electrical engineering, but I have just enough expertise in biomedical sciences and data science to make trouble.

Currently working on an interdisciplinary project involving Electroporation techniques at triple-negative breast cancer cells. I joined Purdue in the spring of 2021 and started working with [Dr Raji Sundararajan] (https://polytechnic.purdue.edu/profile/rsundara) and [Dr Ignacio Camarillo] (https://www.bio.purdue.edu/People/profile/ignacio.html) at [Institute for Cancer Research] (https://www.purdue.edu/cancer-research/).   

Research Interest
======
Applied Scientist leveraging data and experimental expertise to build a miniaturized 3D printed electronic device for personalized treatment of cancer. More than 3-years of work experience in IoT product development and market research in the Start-up ecosystem and 5-years of extensive research in interdisciplinary areas. Inclined towards IoT system design with direct-to-consumer and Healthcare applications.

1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Publication
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
