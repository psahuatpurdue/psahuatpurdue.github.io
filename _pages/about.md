Hi! Iâ€™m Praveen Sahu, a PhD Candidate at Purdue University, West Lafayette, in the School of Engineering Technology. Iâ€™m an applied scientist by training with a background in electrical engineering, but I have just enough expertise in biomedical sciences and data science to make trouble.

Currently working on an interdisciplinary project involving Electroporation techniques on triple-negative breast cancer cells. I joined Purdue in the spring of 2021 and started working with [Dr Raji Sundararajan](https://polytechnic.purdue.edu/profile/rsundara) and [Dr Ignacio Camarillo](https://www.bio.purdue.edu/People/profile/ignacio.html) at [Institute for Cancer Research](https://www.purdue.edu/cancer-research/).   

Research Interest
======
Applied Scientist leveraging data and experimental expertise to build a miniaturized 3D printed electronic device for personalized treatment of cancer. More than 3-years of work experience in IoT product development and market research in the Start-up ecosystem and 5-years of extensive research in interdisciplinary areas. Inclined towards IoT system design with direct-to-consumer and Healthcare applications.

The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
